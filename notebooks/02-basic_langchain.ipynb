      "    *   **Scikit-learn:** For traditional machine learning algorithms.\n",

      "    *   **Matplotlib and Seaborn:** For data visualization.\n",
      "*   **Ease of Use and Readability:** Python's syntax is known for being clear and easy to read, which is beneficial for rapid prototyping and collaboration.\n",
