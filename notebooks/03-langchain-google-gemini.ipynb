      "\n",
      "This theory deals with motion at **constant speeds** (no acceleration). Its two main pillars are:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **The laws of physics are the same for everyone, no matter how they are moving (as long as they're moving at a constant speed).** This means the rules of gravity, electricity, and everything else work the same whether you're standing still or cruising in a spaceship at a steady pace.\n",
      "*   **The speed of light in a vacuum is always the same for everyone, no matter how they are moving.** This is the really mind-bending part. Imagine you're on that fast train and shine a flashlight forward. You might think the light's speed would add to the train's speed, but it doesn't! The person on the ground and you on the train will both measure the light's speed as exactly the same.\n",
      "\n",
      "**What are the consequences of this?**\n",
      "\n",
      "Because the speed of light is constant, other things we thought were constant have to change:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Time Dilation:** Time actually slows down for someone who is moving very fast compared to someone who is standing still. It's like their clock ticks a little slower. This is why astronauts on the International Space Station age slightly slower than people on Earth.\n",
      "*   **Length Contraction:** Objects moving at very high speeds appear shorter in the direction of their motion to an observer who is standing still.\n",
      "*   **Mass-Energy Equivalence (E=mc²):** This is the most famous equation from relativity. It tells us that **energy (E) and mass (m) are essentially the same thing, just in different forms.** A tiny bit of mass can be converted into a huge amount of energy (like in nuclear reactions), and vice versa. The 'c' is the speed of light, which is a very, very big number, so even a small 'm' results in a massive 'E'.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. General Relativity (published in 1915):**\n",
      "\n",
      "This theory expands on special relativity by including **acceleration and gravity.**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Gravity is not a force, but a curvature of spacetime.** Imagine spacetime as a giant, invisible trampoline. If you place a heavy bowling ball (like a planet or a star) on the trampoline, it creates a dip or a curve. When a smaller marble (like a moon or a light ray) rolls nearby, it follows the curve created by the bowling ball. That's what we perceive as gravity! Objects are just following the \"dents\" in spacetime.\n",
      "\n",
      "**What are the consequences of this?**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Bending of Light:** Because gravity warps spacetime, light rays also bend when they pass near massive objects. This has been observed during solar eclipses.\n",
      "*   **Gravitational Time Dilation:** Time also slows down in stronger gravitational fields. Clocks on the ground tick slightly slower than clocks on a mountaintop.\n",
      "*   **Black Holes:** General relativity predicts the existence of black holes, regions of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape.\n",
      "\n",
      "**In a nutshell:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Special Relativity:** Deals with constant motion and says that the speed of light is the ultimate speed limit, leading to weird effects on time and space.\n",
      "*   **General Relativity:** Explains gravity not as a force, but as the warping of spacetime by mass and energy.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's a complex theory, but at its heart, it's about understanding how our perspective on space, time, and gravity changes depending on our motion and the presence of massive objects. It revolutionized our understanding of the universe!\n"
